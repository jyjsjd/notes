# 线程池核心线程数和最大线程数

1. 如果当前线程数少于`corePoolSize`，那么提交任务的时候创建一个新的线程，并由这个线程执行这个任务；
2. 如果线程池是运行状态，并且`workQueue`未满，把任务提交到`workQueue`中；
  2.1 重新检查线程池状态，如果不是运行状态，删除任务并执行`handler`（拒绝策略）；
  2.2 如果线程池是运行状态但可用的线程数为0，则新增线程；
3. 如果队列已满，且线程数少于`maximumPoolSize`，尝试增加线程数；如果失败则执行`handler`（拒绝策略）；
4. 如果队列已满，且线程数大于`maximumPoolSize`，则执行`handler`（拒绝策略）。

~~2. 如果当前线程数已经达到 `corePoolSize`，那么将提交的任务添加到`workQueue`（队列）中，等待线程池中的线程去队列中取任务；~~

~~3. 如果 `workQueue`（队列）已满，那么创建新的线程来执行任务，需要保证池中的线程数不会超过 `maximumPoolSize`，如果此时线程数超过了 `maximumPoolSize`，那么执行 `handler`（拒绝策略）。~~

   /**
     * Executes the given task sometime in the future.  The task
     * may execute in a new thread or in an existing pooled thread.
     *
     * If the task cannot be submitted for execution, either because this
     * executor has been shutdown or because its capacity has been reached,
     * the task is handled by the current {@code RejectedExecutionHandler}.
     *
     * @param command the task to execute
     * @throws RejectedExecutionException at discretion of
     *         {@code RejectedExecutionHandler}, if the task
     *         cannot be accepted for execution
     * @throws NullPointerException if {@code command} is null

         * Proceed in 3 steps:
         *
         * 1. If fewer than corePoolSize threads are running, try to
         * start a new thread with the given command as its first
         * task.  The call to addWorker atomically checks runState and
         * workerCount, and so prevents false alarms that would add
         * threads when it shouldn't, by returning false.
         *
         * 2. If a task can be successfully queued, then we still need
         * to double-check whether we should have added a thread
         * (because existing ones died since last checking) or that
         * the pool shut down since entry into this method. So we
         * recheck state and if necessary roll back the enqueuing if
         * stopped, or start a new thread if there are none.
         *
         * 3. If we cannot queue task, then we try to add a new
         * thread.  If it fails, we know we are shut down or saturated
         * and so reject the task.
