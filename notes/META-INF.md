# META-INF

## The META-INF directory
The following files/directories in the META-INF directory are recognized and interpreted by the Java 2 Platform to configure applications, extensions, class loaders and services:

### MANIFEST.MF
The manifest file that is used to define extension and package related data.

### INDEX.LIST
This file is generated by the new "-i" option of the jar tool, which contains location information for packages defined in an application or extension. It is part of the JarIndex implementation and used by class loaders to speed up their class loading process.

### x.SF
The signature file for the JAR file. 'x' stands for the base file name.

### x.DSA
The signature block file associated with the signature file with the same base file name. This file stores the digital signature of the corresponding signature file.

### services/
